    This feature uses your webcam to remotely detect your health metrics based on 
    subtle changes in your skin tone and facial expressions. Please ensure you are well-lit and positioned 
    in front of the camera for optimal results.
    
    Features:
    - **Heart Rate**: Detected remotely via your webcam.
    - **Respiration Rate**: Measures your breathing rate based on subtle skin tone changes.
    - **Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)**: Estimates your blood oxygen levels.
    - **Stress Level**: Identifies signs of stress or anxiety.
    - **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**: Assesses the variation in your heartbeat intervals.
    - **Blood Pressure Estimate**: Provides an estimate of your blood pressure.
    - **Emotion Recognition**: Detects your emotional state based on facial expressions.
